# Comparing-the-Performance-effect-of-Various-Convolutional-Neural-Network-Architec--tures-on-Automati
n our study, we compared the performance effect of four Different CNN Architectures VGG16, DenseNet121, MobileNet, and ResNet50 (Pre-trained on ImageNet dataset) as encoder, while using LSTM as de- coder in Image captioning . The Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) metric is used to evaluate the results generated by four models. The mean BLEU scores for the Models are VGG16(0.015), DenseNet121(0.010), MobileNet(0.013) and ResNet50(0.024). We evaluated the models on Flickr8K Dataset. Experimental results show that using ResNet50 as CNN encoder shows a huge difference in performance compared to more recent State-of-the-art image classification Networks like DenseNet121 and MobileNet.
